# 1. Housing in Mexico
**In this project, a dataset with 21,000 properties for sale in Mexico is analysed to determine whether sale prices are influenced more by property size or location.**

**Key objectives of this project are:**

1. Organising information using Python data structures.
2. Importing data from CSV files and cleaning it using the pandas library.
3. Creating data visualizations such as scatter and box plots.
4. Examining the relationship between two variables using correlation.

* **SITUATION**: Analyse and describe which of the two factors influence House Prices in Mexico more: Location or House Size
* **TASK**: Python Programming, Prepare and Clean Data, Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Create Visualisations for in-depth analysis
* **APPROACH**: Data Wrangling with Pandas library in Python, Matplotlib and Plotly Express libraries for visualising data
* **RESULT**: It was discovered that house prices per sq.m (i.e. size) is a more realistic representation of housing prices than location
