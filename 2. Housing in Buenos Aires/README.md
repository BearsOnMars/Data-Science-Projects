# 2. Housing in Buenos Aires
**This project involves creating a Machine Learning Linear Regression model that predicts apartment prices in Buenos Aires, Argentina -- with a focus on apartments that cost less than $400,000. The model examines how Apartment Size, Location and Neighbourhood influence prices**

Key objectives of this project are:

1. Creating a linear regression model using the scikit-learn library.
2. Building a data pipeline for imputing missing values and encoding categorical features.
3. Improving model performance by reducing overfitting.
4. Creating a dynamic dashboard for interacting with completed model.

* **SITUATION**: Forecast Apartment Prices in Buenos Aires, Argentina for apartments that cost less than $400,000
* **TASK**: Formulate ML solution, Python Programming, Wrangle data from .csv file, Prepare Data, Build-Iterate-Evaluate Model, Impute missing values
* **ML APPROACH**: Linear Regression Modeling, OneHotEncoding categorical data, deploying Prediction Function and an interactive dashboard for a Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
* **RESULT**: Neighbourhood is much stronger influence in apartment prices than size. The posher the neighbourhood, the higher the apartment price.
