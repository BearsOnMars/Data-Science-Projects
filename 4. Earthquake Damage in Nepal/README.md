# 4. Earthquake Damage in Nepal
**This project involves building a `Classification model` to predict building damage from the Nepal 2015 Earthquake using data from Open Data Nepal.**

**Key Objectives of Project:**
1. Getting data by `querying a SQL database`. Exploring SQL commands e.g.(`SELECT`, `LIMIT`, `COUNT`, `JOIN` etc.)
2. Building a `logistic regression model` for `classification`
3. Building a `decision tree model` for classification
4. Incorporating `ethical considerations` into model building


* **SITUATION**: `Predict` building damage by the 2015 Earthquake in Nepal's Gorkha district.
* **TASK**: Formulate ML Solution, `Query SQL database`, `Sqlite` to import data to Python, `Docstrings`, Drop `Leaky Features`, `Binary Classfication`, Explore `Majority/Minority Classes`, `Pivot Tables`, examine `Multicollinearity`, `Randomised Train-Test Split`, `Validation set`, 
* **ML APPROACH**: `Logistic Regression`, `Extracting Feature Importances`, `Odds Ratios`, `Decision Tree Classifier`, `Ordinal Encoder`, `Hyperparameter Tuning`, `Accuracy Score`, `Gini Importance`, Plotting Tree Model
* **RESULT**: A building superstructure made of brick/cement mortar reduced the likelihood of severe damage by 75%. Whereas a superstructure of stone made a building 400% more likely to have suffered severe damage in earthquake. Superstructure as a feature was found to be reponsible for over 60% increase/decrease in impurity in Decision Tree splits from root to leaves. Inn the demographic analysis, it was observed how a model trained on biased data could end up perpetuating systems of social injustice and exacerbate problems.
