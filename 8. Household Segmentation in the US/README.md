# [Household Segmentation in the US](https://github.com/BearsOnMars/Data-Science-Projects/tree/main/8.%20Household%20Segmentation%20in%20the%20US)

In this project, data from the [Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF)](https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/aboutscf.htm), which is sponsored by the US Federal Reserve, is analysed. It tracks financial, demographic, and opinion information about families in the United States. The survey is conducted every three years. An extract of the results from 2019 is chosen for analysis. Here is the [Code Book](https://sda.berkeley.edu/sdaweb/docs/scfcomb2019/DOC/hcbkh01.htm) for the data.

* `OBJECTIVES OF THE PROJECT:`

    * Comparing characteristics across subgroups using a side-by-side bar chart.
    * Building a `k-means clustering` model.
    * Conducting feature selection for clustering based on variance.
    * Reducing high-dimensional data using `principal component analysis (PCA)`.
    * Designing, building and deploying a Dash web application.

* **SITUATION**: Analyse SCF data, identify key Household Clusters, deploy Dash web application
* **TASK**: Formulate ML Solution, `Exploratory Data Analysis`, Feature Selection, `Dimensionality Reduction`, Dash web application
* **ML APPROACH**: `Unsupervised Learning`, `Trimmed Variance`, Standardisation: `Standard Scaler`, `K-Means Clustering`, Principal Component Analysis `PCA`, `Inertia` errors, `Silhouette Score`, Dash app layout: `Business Layer`, `Service Layer`
* **RESULT**: Key Household clusters were identified, notable relationships were observed in the dataset, interactive web application in dash was created.
