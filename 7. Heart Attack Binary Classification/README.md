## [Heart Attack Binary Classification](https://github.com/BearsOnMars/Data-Science-Projects/tree/main/7.%20Heart%20Attack%20Binary%20Classification)
**In this project, Medical Health data is explored. The goal is to build a Binary Classification model that can predict whether a patient would have a heart attack or not, and to identify the most important features which contribute to a heart attack.**

**Key objectives of this Project:**

1. Explore the medical data
2. Apply feature engineering, choose the appropriate ML models to train, and evaluate performance 

* **SITUATION**: `Predict` whether a patient is at a High Risk of a Heart Attack or Not.
* **TASK**: Formulate ML Solution, Exploratory Data Analysis, `Positive/Negative Class`, Feature Engineering, Evaluate Models
* **ML APPROACH**: Logistic Regression, `Ensemble Model`, `Random forest Classifier`, `Gradient Boosting Trees`, `Classification Report`, `CrossValidation`, `Hyperparameter Grid Search`, `ROC Curve, AUC`, `log_loss`
* **RESULT**: Logistic Regression Model was found to be the best performing model out of three. It had the highest AUC at 0.95 and the lowest log loss at 0.29. And above all, it took the least resources to train the data on Logistic Regression model
